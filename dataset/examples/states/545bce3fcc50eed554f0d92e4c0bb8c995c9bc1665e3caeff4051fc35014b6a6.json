For example, polar bears are well-adapted to live in the Arctic - their white fur provides camouflage, they have thick layers of fat for insulation, and large paws that allow them to walk on snow and ice. Penguins live in cold climates near the ocean because they can swim and catch fish, but need the cold temperatures to survive. Fish live only in the water because that is the only place they can breathe through gills. Different animals have evolved specialized adaptations that allow them to survive in the habitats where they live.
