For example, polar bears have thick fur and insulating fat to survive cold Arctic climates, while camels can go a long time without water to live in hot, dry deserts. Animals evolve specialized traits over time that allow them to thrive in the conditions of their native habitat. If they were transplanted somewhere new, they would likely struggle to find food, stay warm or cool enough, and avoid predators. Each species fills an ecological niche in the place where it belongs. The habitats animals live in match their physical, behavioral, and dietary adaptations. An animal's habitat provides the resources it needs to survive and reproduce. Over time, animals become intimately connected to and reliant on their home environments. This explains why different species of animals are found living in certain regions of the world.",

Things like dental disease, tumors, heart conditions can often be found and treated more easily if detected early. - Vets can provide age-appropriate screenings and vaccines to prevent issues like parasites, infectious diseases, and cancers. Staying current on vaccines is key to keeping pets protected. - Annual exams allow vets to monitor pets for changes over time. Subtle weight loss, new lumps, or behavior changes may signal underlying disease. - Routine care provides a chance to discuss diet, behavior, exercise, and any concerns with the vet while pets are still healthy. This helps set them up for a long, happy life. - Check-ups support overall wellness rather than just treating illness. They help pets live longer, healthier lives.",
