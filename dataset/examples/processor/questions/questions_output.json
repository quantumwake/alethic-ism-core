Some key evolutionary changes include a reduction in aggressive behavior, increased egg-laying, and adaptations for meat production like increased body size. The dozens of chicken breeds we have now are the result of isolating and selecting for particular traits over generations.

So the egg came first. - Proto-chickens that were almost chickens, but not quite, laid eggs containing the first true chickens. So the egg came first. - The first chicken was genetically distinct from its parents and thus came about through some other evolutionary process, not being hatched from an egg.

Some key evolutionary changes include a reduction in aggressive behavior, increased egg-laying, and adaptations for meat production like increased body size. The dozens of chicken breeds we have now are the result of isolating and selecting for particular traits over generations.

So the egg came first. - Proto-chickens that were almost chickens, but not quite, laid eggs containing the first true chickens. So the egg came first. - The first chicken was genetically distinct from its parents and thus came about through some other evolutionary process, not being hatched from an egg.

The yellow color helps camouflage the vulnerable chicks in their environment. After a few weeks, as chicks grow feathers, their color changes to white, brown, black etc. depending on the breed.
