For example, polar bears have thick fur and insulating fat to survive cold Arctic climates, while camels can go a long time without water to live in hot, dry deserts. Animals evolve specialized traits over time that allow them to thrive in the conditions of their native habitat. If they were transplanted somewhere new, they would likely struggle to find food, stay warm or cool enough, and avoid predators. Each species fills an ecological niche in the place where it belongs. The habitats animals live in match their physical, behavioral, and dietary adaptations. An animal's habitat provides the resources it needs to survive and reproduce.
