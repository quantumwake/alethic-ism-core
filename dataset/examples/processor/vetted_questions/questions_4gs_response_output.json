Reptiles and amphibians seek shelter under rocks, logs, or in burrows. The type of home an animal needs depends on their species, habitat, and survival needs. Overall, animals tend to seek out homes that provide shelter, safety, and access to food and resources.

Provide your response in a short summary paragraph. Only provide the response.","Animals live in certain places due to their adaptations and requirements for survival. For example, polar bears are well-adapted to live in the Arctic - their white fur provides camouflage, they have thick layers of fat for insulation, and large paws that allow them to walk on snow and ice. Penguins live in cold climates near the ocean because they can swim and catch fish, but need the cold temperatures to survive. Fish live only in the water because that is the only place they can breathe through gills. Different animals have evolved specialized adaptations that allow them to survive in the habitats where they live. The places they live provide the food, shelter, climate conditions, and other resources they need. Their anatomy, behavior, and physiology are finely tuned to the particular environment.",Success,Why do some animals only live in certain places?,Animals and the Place They Live

Provide your response in a short summary paragraph. Only provide the response.","There is evidence that many animals have cognitive abilities and can think and solve problems. For example, chimpanzees have been shown to use tools, dolphins communicate in complex ways, elephants exhibit grieving behaviors, and crows solve multi-step puzzles. While animal cognition may be very different from human cognition in many ways, research suggests that animals possess some level of intelligence, emotion, social skills, memory and learning capacity. Overall, scientific studies provide compelling evidence that at least some animal species have cognitive faculties that enable thinking, reasoning and problem-solving to varying degrees.",Success,Can animals think and solve problems?,Thinking and Feeling Animals
