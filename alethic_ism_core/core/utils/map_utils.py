# The Alethic Instruction-Based State Machine (ISM) is a versatile framework designed to 
# efficiently process a broad spectrum of instructions. Initially conceived to prioritize
# animal welfare, it employs language-based instructions in a graph of interconnected
# processing and state transitions, to rigorously evaluate and benchmark AI models
# apropos of their implications for animal well-being. 
# 
# This foundation in ethical evaluation sets the stage for the framework's broader applications,
# including legal, medical, multi-dialogue conversational systems.
